# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 for Laura Jordan

## Description
This was a ETL mini project that practiced building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and a Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, I created CSV files which I then used to create an ERD and a table schema. Lastly, I uploaded the CSV files into a Postgres database. 

The project was divided into 4 subsections:
* Creating the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
* Creating the Campaign DataFrame
* Creating the Contacts DataFrame
* Creating the Crowdfunding Database

## Support
I attended class, reviewed my notes, and worked with my classmates for the support needed for this challenge assignment.
